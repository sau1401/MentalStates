# Mental States Screensaver

A simple screensaver (can be converted if properly built) that can represent the messy mental state one can be in.

## how the hell can i get this to work?

As far as I am aware, this only works on Windows machines as of now (as Windows is quite literally built on C#). So, if you have a Windows machine, fork or do whatever you please with the files, and change the exe file IN the folder to "MentalStates.scr" and it should work. ***DO NOT REMOVE IT FROM THE FOLDER!! IT NEEDS THE DLL!!***

Once you're finished changing the file type, right click and "install" it. Should work! Check your screensavers in your settings.

If it doesn't, try searching up other ways to get this to work. This is the quickest method I know at the top of my head.

You can also just keep it as an .exe and run it whenever you wanna walk away from your PC/laptop, your choice!
