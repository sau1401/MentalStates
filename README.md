# Mental States Screensaver

A simple screensaver (can be converted if properly built) that can represent the messy mental state one can be in.

Just note: it only escapes when you press a button! You can interact with the scene with mouse input!!

## how the hell can i get this to work?

As far as I am aware, this only works on Windows machines as of now (as Windows is quite literally built on C#). So, if you have a Windows machine, fork or do whatever you please with the files, and change the exe file IN the folder to "MentalStates.scr" and it should work. ***DO NOT REMOVE IT FROM THE FOLDER!! IT NEEDS THE DLL!!***

Once you're finished changing the file type, right click and "install" it. Should work! Check your screensavers in your settings.

If it doesn't, try searching up other ways to get this to work. This is the quickest method I know at the top of my head.

You can also just keep it as an .exe and run it whenever you wanna walk away from your PC/laptop, your choice!

## editing this

If you want to change the speed of the spheres or add just other customization options, go into the Form1.cs file and look around. But, if you're stuck with what does what, do try to search it up before editing it! Things are in specific places for a reason and mostly everything is laid out for ease of reading. You can also add a "settings" option for the screensaver if you know how to do that!
