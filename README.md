# Mental States Screensaver

A simple screensaver (can be converted if properly built) that can represent the messy mental state one can be in.

Just note: it only escapes when you press a button! You can interact with the scene with mouse input!!

## how the hell can i get this to work?

As far as I am aware, this only works on **Windows machines** (as Windows is quite literally built on C#; **I'm not sure if the exe works for Linux/Unix (MacOS too!)** because they require different extensions for screensavers). So, if you have a Windows machine, fork or do whatever you please with the files, but you will have to build it! Uploading executables to GitHub wasn't the best move. W

### how to compile/build
- open Form1.cs
- build/debug whatever
- should have a folder with the exe
- change the .exe to .scr

Once you're finished changing the file type, **right click and "install" it**. Should work! Check your screensavers in your settings.

If it doesn't, try searching up other ways to get this to work. This is the quickest method I know at the top of my head.

You can also just keep it as an .exe and run it whenever you wanna walk away from your PC/laptop, your choice!

## editing this

If you want to change the speed of the spheres or add just other customization options, go into the Form1.cs file and look around. But, if you're stuck with what does what, do try to search it up before editing it! Things are in specific places for a reason and mostly everything is laid out for ease of reading. You can also add a "settings" option for the screensaver if you know how to do that!

Some documentation will help and some won't. But please feel free to let your creativity go wild! You can generate more shapes and sizes with some simple changes and adding a few more classes. Not to mention add some customization to mental states that aren't implemented fully.
